# Cowin Vaccine Booking script

[Cowin Portal](https://www.cowin.gov.in/) is an Indian government portal to book vaccine slots.
Due to limited number of vaccines , getting a vaccine slot was a hassle.

The script was developed to book slots for the group, friends, family and knowns.

This script uses public APIs and private information of the user to periodically check for open slots and
book the relevant slot when it opens.

This script is dependent on an app to be completely automated(will be posted soon). It can be modified to enter the OTP manually.

The user of this scripts needs to enter their respective beneficiary id in config/config.json
